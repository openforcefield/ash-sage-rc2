# Downloading data

The subdirectories here contain scripts for initial downloading and processing of physical property data (physprop) and QM data from QCArchive (qm). This data is later used in the fit. Where size allows, the datasets themselves have been uploaded.

Please see the following READMEs for more information on the final training or benchmarking data sets for:

* [physical properties](https://github.com/lilyminium/ash-sage-rc2/tree/main/01_download-data/physprop/final)
* [QM](https://github.com/lilyminium/ash-sage-rc2/blob/main/01_download-data/README.md)
