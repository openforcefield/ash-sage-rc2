# Valence fit

This directory includes the actual valence fit of the force field.

**Note: we had to remove `opt-geo-batch-16` from the fitting targets as one optimization repeatedly failed to converge.**

* `optimize.in` is the ForceBalance input file.
* `targets.tar.gz` are the fitting targets.
* `forcefield/force-field.offxml` is the initial force field.
